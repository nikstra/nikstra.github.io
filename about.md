My name is Niklas Strand. I'm a .NET developer and a general tech geek. I often find myself trying to remember where I've found a solution to a problem that I had earlier and spending a lot of time finding the solution again. I've created this site to be able to write down these solutions and have them all in one place.

I'll mainly write about programming and various computer related issues but I'm not limiting myself to those subjects. The future will tell.
